          <p>
            Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to
            join Barcelona at the age of 13, for whom he made his competitive
            debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral
            player for the club within the next three years, and in his first
            uninterrupted season in 2008â€“09 he helped Barcelona achieve the
            first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his
            first Ballon d'Or.
