<p>Para 1</p>
The <b>United States</b> is proud to partner in <b>Bangladesh's</b> development success. Over the last 50 years, Bangladeshâ€™s economy expanded from a largely agricultural society to one with the potential to become a major participant in global <b><u> <i> Supply Chain</i></u> </b>.  Its enviable growth and openness to U.S. private sector investment makes this market an opportunity for U.S. firms and those of our allies and partners.  For the past 20 years, the economy in Bangladesh has grown at over 6 percent every year.  The United States is the largest importer of Bangladeshi products, importing $8.3 billion in 2021.   U.S. companies are the largest foreign investors in Bangladesh, making the United States the top source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in 2021.  U.S. companies have made $4.3 billion in investments as of 2021, which accounts for 20 percent of the total FDI stock in Bangladesh.   The vast majority of these investments are in natural gas extraction, banking and insurance, and power generation sectors.  U.S. companies also contribute to the transportation and infrastructure sectors by providing high-quality airplanes, locomotives, power generation turbines, and dredging equipment among other products.  The growing commercial ties between the United States and Bangladesh have been further demonstrated through the establishment of the U.S.-Bangladesh Business Council in 2021.

<b><u><i> Bangladesh Member Between International Organixation</i></u></b>
Bangladesh and the United States belong to a number of the same international organizations, including the United Nations, ASEAN Regional Forum, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization.  Bangladesh is also a positive contributor for regional integration in the Indo-Pacific through its active participation in organizations such as the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal (BBIN) Initiative, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA).  Bangladesh completed its second term as Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum in June 2022.
